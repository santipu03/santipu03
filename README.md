Hello there! 🙌
I'm a **Blockchain Security Researcher** whose job is to catch bugs and prevent blackhats from stealing money. 🐛

Also, I'm a **Senior Watson** at [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), which is one of the top-tier audit marketplaces.

## 🔎 Competitive Audits 

Audit contests are the fastest way to improve my auditing skills because I compete against hundreds of security researchers worldwide. This allows me to learn from the best ones and earn some experience, at the same time that I get rewarded. 🫡
