# Security Portfolio - Santipu

Hello there! üôå

I‚Äôm Santipu, a **Blockchain Security Researcher** who mainly works on contest platforms such as [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), and [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/). I‚Äôve had the chance to place on the podium multiple times in audit contests, including a few first-place finishes, and I‚Äôve collaborated with leading audit firms like [Pashov Audit Group](https://www.pashov.net/) and [Bailsec](https://bailsec.io/).

Feel free to reach out to me on X (formerly Twitter) at [@santipu_](https://x.com/santipu_).

## üîé Competitive Audits 

Audit contests are the fastest way to improve my auditing skills because I compete against hundreds of security researchers worldwide. This allows me to learn from the best ones and earn some experience, at the same time that I get rewarded. ü´°

## üêû Bug Bounties

Occasionally, I like to dedicate some time to catching bugs in the wild.
